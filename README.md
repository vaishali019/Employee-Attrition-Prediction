# Employee-Attrition-Prediction
Employee attrition (or turnover) is a major challenge for organizations, as it directly impacts workforce stability and business performance. This project aims to predict whether an employee is likely to leave the organization based on historical HR data.

By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the model identifies key factors influencing attrition and provides insights that can help HR teams in decision-making and retention strategies.

üéØ Objectives

Analyze HR data to understand patterns of employee attrition.

Build predictive models to classify employees as "Likely to Leave" or "Likely to Stay".

Identify the most significant factors contributing to attrition.

Provide data-driven insights to improve employee retention.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries/Frameworks: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Modeling: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Decision Tree (comparative analysis)

Visualization: Matplotlib & Seaborn for EDA
